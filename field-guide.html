            <!-- Academic Magic Card -->
            <div class="guide-card">
                <img src="/images/academic-magic.webp"
                    alt="An open grimoire or textbook illuminated by a lantern, with swirling runic symbols hovering above the pages and nearby academic tools.">
                <h3>Academic Magic</h3>
                <p>
                    This structured form of wizardry relies on master spells, careful study,
                    and disciplined practice. From runic diagrams to meticulously memorized incantations,
                    Academic Magic forms the backbone of any formal wizard’s education.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Natural Magic Card -->
            <div class="guide-card">
                <img src="/images/natural-magic.webp"
                    alt="A silhouette of a figure in a forest clearing at dusk, with tree roots lightly wrapped around their legs, glowing motes in the air.">
                <h3>Natural Magic</h3>
                <p>
                    Tied to the essence of living things, Natural Magic involves aligning one's own nature
                    with the energies at play. Whether tapping into the rhythms of the forest or
                    melding with the spirit of a raging storm, practitioners approach problems
                    by becoming part of the solution itself.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- The Fae Card -->
            <div class="guide-card">
                <img src="/images/fae.webp"
                    alt="A regal Fae court scene in a twilight forest, featuring King Oberon and varied Fae creatures with glowing eyes and flowers.">
                <h3>The Fae</h3>
                <p>
                    Mysterious beings who inhabit the Thinning, the Fae are as varied as they are ancient.
                    Led by King Oberon, they range from mischievous sprites and ascendant animals
                    to the imposing High Fae who guard the very fabric of their hidden realm.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Gremlins / Minor Creatures Card -->
            <div class="guide-card">
                <img src="/images/creatures.webp"
                    alt="A collage of minor creatures: mischievous gremlins, glowing changeling silhouettes, and whimsical fae critters.">
                <h3>Creatures & Critters</h3>
                <p>
                    Beyond the High Fae, Oak Grove is home to an array of lesser-known entities—gremlins,
                    changelings, and other oddities that slip through cracks in the barrier.
                    Though smaller in stature, they can cause outsized mischief if left unchecked.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Artifacts & Tools Card -->
            <div class="guide-card">
                <img src="/images/artifacts-tools.webp"
                    alt="A rustic workbench strewn with magical tools: Morgan's hammer with arcane engravings and various enchanted items.">
                <h3>Artifacts & Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    From intricately carved staffs to personal foci like Morgan’s hammer,
                    artifacts are essential for harnessing magic. These items often bear
                    generations of stories, and losing one can break a wizard’s link to their craft.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- Law of Forgetting Card -->
            <div class="guide-card">
                <img src="/images/law-of-forgetting.webp"
                    alt="A magical scene fading from memory: shimmering lights being forgotten, symbolizing erased memories.">
                <h3>The Law of Forgetting</h3>
                <p>
                    Central to the hidden world of Oak Grove, this mystical rule ensures
                    that magic cannot persist in the minds of those who refuse to believe.
                    Observers quickly dismiss enchanting events as tricks of light,
                    mass hysteria, or misremembered accidents.
