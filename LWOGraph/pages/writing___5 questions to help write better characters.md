In her article, "5 Questions to Help You Write Better Characters," Savannah Gilbo emphasizes the importance of developing well-rounded characters to create compelling stories. She proposes five essential questions writers should consider:

-
- ### **What does your character want?**
  
  Every character should have a clear, overarching goal that drives the narrative. For instance, in *The Hunger Games*, Katniss aims to win the games. Identifying such primary objectives, along with smaller, scene-specific goals, helps in structuring the plot.
-
- ### **Why does your character want this?**
  
  Understanding the motivation behind a character's goal adds depth. Katniss volunteers as tribute to protect her sister, Prim, showcasing her protective nature. This motivation propels her actions throughout the story.
-
- ### **What’s standing in your character’s way externally?**
  External obstacles create conflict and drive the plot. These can include antagonistic characters or challenging circumstances that hinder the protagonist's progress.
-
- ### **What’s standing in your character’s way internally?**
  
  Internal conflicts, such as fears or false beliefs stemming from past experiences, add layers to a character. Identifying these internal barriers enriches character development and makes their journey more relatable.
