            <h2>Chapter 1: A Founding of Uncertainty</h2>
            <p>
                Oak Grove's history begins not with a grand declaration, but with a series of mysterious
                events that shaped its founding. In the years following the Civil War, settlers traveling
                westward stumbled upon the dense oak forests and found themselves inexplicably drawn to
                the area. Strange lights in the night sky and unusual weather patterns led many to believe
                the land was enchanted or cursed. These tales attracted pioneers seeking both opportunity
                and the unknown.

                <strong>Did You Know?</strong>
                Early settlers referred to the forest as "The Shrouded Wood" due to the persistent mist
                that seemed to cling to the trees, even on sunny days. It was this atmosphere that inspired
                the name "Oak Grove."

            <h2>Chapter 2: Building the Barrier</h2>
            <p>
                Concerned that the uncanny force behind the disappearance could threaten the young nation’s
                stability, the Union forces constructed a boundary along the perimeter of the forest. Guided
                by military engineers and supervised by a handful of discreet wizards, they placed wards
                along a rudimentary wooden fence. This fence would eventually evolve into the protective
                barrier Oak Grove relies upon to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the following decades, the soldiers stationed to maintain the barrier settled in the
                surrounding area. By the end of the Civil War (1865), a fledgling town had formed—named Oak Grove for
                the dense stands of oak trees that once filled the region. While its original purpose was a
                closely guarded secret, Oak Grove began to attract pioneers looking to carve out a living
                far from bustling coastal cities.

            <h2>Chapter 3: The Retreat & the Wizards Who Remained</h2>
            <p>
                In the decades after the Civil War, political and economic changes led the United States to withdraw
                many of its soldiers from remote outposts. By the late 19th century, nearly all official military
                oversight in Oak Grove had ceased. However, the small cadre of wizards—originally stationed to guard
                against otherworldly incursions—chose to stay behind. Their descendants took up the mantle of protecting
                the town and maintaining the barrier.
