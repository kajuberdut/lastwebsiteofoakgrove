    <h2>Welcome to Oak Grove</h2>
    <p>
      Sixteen-year-old Morgan never asked to be the last wizard of Oak Grove. After her father’s untimely death, she inherits the responsibility of maintaining the magical barrier that keeps her small town safe from the Fae realm—a barrier that has protected Oak Grove for over a century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caught between the pressures of school, friendships, and her grief, Morgan struggles to live up to her father’s legacy. But as attacks from the Thinning intensify, she discovers a deeper plot led by Caelia, the changeling daughter of Oberon, King of the Fae. With the balance between worlds at stake, Morgan must uncover her own strength, or risk losing everything.
